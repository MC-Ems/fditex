\subsection{PSM}
Since (I guess) we will be focussing on ATE rather than ATT, we need to satisfy the following two assumptions: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Assumption: \textbf{Unconfoundedness (CIA)} \\
"\textit{[G]iven a set of observable covariates X which are not affected by treatment, potential outcomes are independent of treatment assignment}"   \citep[p.~35]{CaliendoHujerThomsen2008}	 

\item Assumption: \textbf{Overlap} \\
"\textit{persons with the same X values have a positive probability of being both participants and nonparticipants}" \citet [p.~35]{Caliendo08}

\end{enumerate}
--> if Assumption 1 holds, all biases due to observable components can be removed by conditioning on the propensity score (Imbens, 2004).

\subsubsection*{Binary Treatment}
Difference between logit and probit lies in the link function. Logit assumes a log-distribution of residuals, probit assumes a normal distribution. Heteroskedastic probit models can account for non-constant error variances --> Check for heteroskedasticity?

\subsubsection*{Multiple Treatments}
The multinomial probit model is the preferable option compared to logit. Alternatively, just run several binary ones (more complicated but also more robust to errors).

\subsubsection*{Variable selection}
\begin{itemize}
\item outcome variable must be independent of treatment conditional on the pscore (CIA)
\item Only variables that influence simultaneously the participation decision and the outcome variable should be included (based on theory and empirical findings)
\item variables should either be fixed over time or measured before participation (include only variables unaffeted by participation)
\item choice of variables should be based on economic theory and previous empirical findings
\end{itemize}
