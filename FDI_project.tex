\section{Introduction}



\section{Theoretical Background/Literature Review}

\subsection{FDI}

\subsection{PSM}
Since (I guess) we will be focussing on ATE rather than ATT, we need to satisfy the following two assumptions: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Assumption: \textbf{Unconfoundedness (CIA)} \\
"\textit{[G]iven a set of observable covariates X which are not affected by treatment, potential outcomes are independent of treatment assignment}"   \citep[p.~35]{CaliendoHujerThomsen2008}	 

\item Assumption: \textbf{Overlap} \\
"\textit{persons with the same X values have a positive probability of being both participants and nonparticipants}" \citet [p.~35]{Caliendo08}

\end{enumerate}
--> if Assumption 1 holds, all biases due to observable components can be removed by conditioning on the propensity score (Imbens, 2004).

\subsubsection*{Binary Treatment}
Difference between logit and probit lies in the link function. Logit assumes a log-distribution of residuals, probit assumes a normal distribution. Heteroskedastic probit models can account for non-constant error variances --> Check for heteroskedasticity?

\subsubsection*{Multiple Treatments}
The multinomial probit model is the preferable option compared to logit. Alternatively, just run several binary ones (more complicated but also more robust to errors).

\subsubsection*{Variable selection}
\begin{itemize}
\item outcome variable must be independent of treatment conditional on the pscore (CIA)
\item Only variables that influence simultaneously the participation decision and the outcome variable should be included (based on theory and empirical findings)
\item variables should either be fixed over time or measured before participation (include only variables unaffeted by participation)
\item choice of variables should be based on economic theory and previous empirical findings
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Tests for variable selection}
Strategies for the selection of variables to be used in estimating the propensity score: ...


\section{Data and Descriptive Analysis}
Our analysis is based on observational firm-level data. The dataset comprises 11,323 firms, of which 4,460 received FDI in 2016. The FDI can be divided into three subcategories. Table \ref{tab:freq} shows the frequencies of each type of FDI in our sample. Among the recipients of FDI, most firms (1,965) received domestic market seeking FDI. 1,555 firms received technology intensive FDI and the remaining 640 firms received exports oriented FDI. The TFP outcome was measured in 2017. We standardize \footnote{Using Z-score standardization} the outcome variable to make its interpretation more intuitive. % We standardize the outcome to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

%--------------------TABLE 1
\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\caption{Frequency of FDI Types} 
	\input{fditype_freq}
\label{tab:freq}
\end{table}
%---------------------------

A set of categorical and continuous control variables was measured in 2015 (one year prior to the firms receiving FDI). Table \ref{tab:cat} provides an overview of the categorical variables and the frequencies of each category in our sample. The categorical variables are included as factor variables in the subsequent analysis. The port variable indicates whether a firm has access to a port within 500km. The legal ownership of a firm is captured in the ownership variable, where state owned firms represent the base group. The technology intensity of the industry the respective firm is operating in, is measured in four categories from low- to high-tech, low-tech being the base group. The R\&D dummy indicates whether a firm has invested in Research and Design in 2015. \\

%-------------------------TABLE 2
\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\caption{Summary Statistics of Categorical Covariates} 
	\input{cat_freq}
	\label{tab:cat}	
\end{table}
%--------------------------------

The summary statistics of the continuous variables wages, Total Factor Productivity (TFP), firm size (measured in number of employees), debts and the firms' export intensity are displayed in Table \ref{tab:cont}. The variables wages, employment and, to a lesser extent, debts show large differences between their mean and median values, hinting at the existence of outliers in the sample. Log transforming the skewed variables is an easy way of reducing the influence of extreme values. 

%-----------------------TABLE 3
\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\caption{Summary Statistics of Continuous Covaraites} 
	\input{cont_summ}
	\label{tab:cont}
\end{table}
%------------------------------

However, during placebo estimation with a different outcome it became clear that not taking the logarithm of employment yields better covariate balance in all models. Therefore we use the untransformed variable. Noting an extreme value in the variable (see Figure \ref{fig:outliers}) we added a robustness check that excluded this observation, yielding essentially the same results.

	\caption{Outliers in Employment Variable}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{emp15_outliers}
  	\label{fig:outliers}
\end{figure} 
%---------------------------

To further motivate the use of matching estimators in estimating the effect of FDI on a firm's TFP, the differences in means between the firms that received FDI and the firms that did not are displayed in Table \ref{tab:meandiff1}. The t-tests show significant differences in all observable characteristics, meaning that there is in fact selection into treatment.

	\label{tab:meandiff1}
\end{table}
%------------------------------------------


\section{Empirical Specification}

In order to evaluate the causal effect of FDI on Total Factor Productivity (TFP) we estimate our main model described in equation (1) using nearest neighbour matching with one neighbour and with replacement. Second, we also estimate a nearest neighbour model with 5 neighbors with replacement and a caliper of 0.05. Further, we use inverse probability weighting (IPW) and augmented-inverse probability weighting (AIPW) estimators. Since we have a large sample, the different estimators should all yield essentially the same results.

For the matching, weighting  and regression adjustment models we use the same specification including the beforementioned categorical and continuous variables. We unlog employment to improve covariate balance. We do not include the export variable as a matching covariate, since together with technology it predicts treatment too well and nearly eliminates overlap. 
As propensity score matching requires that all covariates which affect both outcome and likelihood of treatment, we can exlude export since it does not influence the outcome variable. As Girma et al (2004) show, productivity increases exports, not the other way around. We do not include the port variable for the same theoretical reason.
We assume that selection occurs only on our specified observables, thus assuming that the conditional independece assumption holds. 
 

%--------------------------------EQUATION 1
\begin{align*}
TFP  =&  \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} FDI + \beta_{2} X_{i 2015} + \epsilon_{i}   
\end{align*}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{FDI} is a non-random treatment variable. It takes value 1 in case of treatment, 0 otherwise;
\item  $X_{i 2015}$ describes control variables and consists of following pre-treatment covariates: Ownership, Technology Intensity, Research\&Development, logarithm of Wages, Total Factor Productivity, Employment and Debts
\end{itemize}
%------------------------------------------

Our matching model is thus a logit regression of TFP in 2017 on Ownership, Technology Intensity, Research\&Development, logarithm of Wages, TFP in 2015, Employment and Debts. This very good overlap and covariate balances (the latter discussed in more detail down below). Figure two shows proof of sufficient overlap for a matching analysis. 

%-------------------FIGURE 2
\begin{figure}[h]\centering
	\caption{Overlap in Main Model}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{overlap}
  	\label{fig:overlap}
\end{figure} 
%---------------------------


The main findings of this paper are displayed in Table \ref{tab:mainresults}. It reports the Average Treatment Effects (ATE) for FDI on TFP. Across estimators, we find large and highly significant coefficients showing that receiving FDI increases TFP of companies on average. The reported coefficients differ only slighlty in magnitude, suggesting that the matching model is correctly specified.  Column (1) shows the results of a one-to-one propensity score matching with replacement. Receiving FDI  increases Factor Productivity by 13\% of a standard deviation for the average company. Sligthly lower results are obtained from a propensity score matching with five nearest neighbors and a caliper of 0.05 as well as for the invers IPW. The doubly robust AIPW-estimator is slighlty larger than the main model, but the estimators are within three percent of each other.

Checking the covariate balances of our models, we prefer the one-to-one propensity score matching as it gives us the best covariate balance of all the estimators \textit{see Appendix}. In the next subsection, we probe the sensitivity of your findings in  more detail for one-to-one propensity score matching.

%------------------------------------------



\subsection{Robustness of Results}

Table \ref{tab:robust} reports several alternative model specifications that confirm the robustness of our main results. The positive and significant effect of foreign investment on total factor productivity persists. In column (1), we add interaction terms of the dummy variables with the continuous regressors to our set of covariates. This is widely practized to improve covariate balance (Caliendo et al. 2008).
The Average Treatment Effect of FDI on productivity slightly increases but only by 2.7\% of a standard deviation. The covariate balance does not improve with the inclusion of interaction terms, suggesting that interactions do not increase the quality of matching in our case.\footnote{The same holds true when interacting only dummy variables, only continuous variables or all variables.} One possible source of bias could be the outlier in the employment variable. While most of the firms have employee numbers close to the mean of 7,111, we are concerned about two observations with extreme values: one firm with over eight million employees, and another one that apparently employed more than 4 million people in 2015.\footnote{Given the limited information our dataset contains, we cannot be sure in which unit employment is measured. We therefore suppose that the common definition of employment being the number of hired employees holds.}  To check whether these outliers influence our main findings, we exclude the two extreme observations. The results reported in column (2) show no significant change in the average treatment effect. %Note% should do F-test for equality of coefficients?%
In our main specification, we have further assumed that a port being within 500 km of the firm does not influence total factor productivity. Column (3) confirms that this is indeed the case, as the results do not change with the inclusion of the dummy variable port in our set of covariates.

\end{tablenotes}

\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}
%--------------------------------------

Finally, column (4) reports the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) of the nearest neighbor matching with one neighbor and replacement. Because we assume that treatment is not exogenous, we might find stronger effects of treatment on the treated. This would be the case if those firms receiving treatment are also the ones benefiting more from it. However, our estimate in column (4) reports an ATT that is very similar to the average treatment effect for the hypothetical case that all firms had received FDI. %This suggests that the propensity score matching performed very well in randomizing treatment and control groups. ALT: This suggests that although there was selection into treatment the effect size would be very similar in the absense of such selection. 

%maybe in conclusion/ limits of paper
One shortcoming of our analysis is the missing capability of explaining the mechanisms behind the observed treatment effects. We do not distinguish between within-firm effects and spillover effects from firms receiving FDI on other firms. That is, the literature on spillover effects typically suggests spillovers within sectors rather than across sectors (SOURCE) and higher spillover effects on nearby firms or firms that are trading factor inputs with foreign-owned companies (SOURCE). Due to the limited information on a firm's sector and location, we are unable to measure spillover effects. 




\section{Analysis by Type}


To further test the robustness of our results  we continue our analysis by looking at potential heterogeneity of the treatment effect across types of FDI. Recall the three types of FDI from table 1 as Exports oriented, Technology intensive and Domestic market seeking, with the the latter being most common and the first being least common.
We test the possibility that one specific type of Investment single handedly drives our previous results.  It is possible, that for example only exports-oriented increased factor productivity while the other two types had little or no impact. 

We estimate an augmented IPW model with multi-valued treatment effects. The matching covariates are the same as in the previous model and the regression adjustment specification is the same as that for propensity score estimation. The covariate balance is good, but the variance ratio of employment (unlogged) is a borderline case. \footnote{Unfortunately an AIPW model with any interactions did not converge, so it was impossible to try and improve the balance this way.}

Second, we estimate an IPW model to check if it yields similar estimates without regression adjustment. The covariate balance in this model is practially the same. Finally, we estimate a set of AIPW models where we restrict the sample to one type of treatment each. This allows for the IIA assumption to be relaxed which is required for the Mulitnomial Logit models. The seperate models have worse covariate balance than the first two but are borderline acceptable. The overlap assumption is satisfied for all treatment levels as can be seen in graph \ref{fig:psbytype}. 


In Table \ref{tab:bytype} the results from the typewise analysis are shown. In the AIPW Multinomial specification the ATE of different types of FDI are within half a percent of of each other. This suggests, that all types of FDI increase factor productivtiy by essentially the same margin. The estimated effect size is close to the one estimated for FDI in table 2. In the IPW specification the differences slightly larger but still within 5\% of a standard deviation of each other.  The seperate logit models also yield essentially the same effect sizes as the multinomial specification. Since the AIPW estimator is doubly robust (assuming correctly specified regression adjustment models) models (1) and (3) provide us with strong evidence of homogenous effects.

Thoughts on what we could write for discussion/limits of our study: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do not know much about the context of the treatment (so cannot really rule out anticipation-effects?)
\item Would have been interesting to extend the study to several years after the treatment. Do effects persist? Do they vanish? 
\item Might depend on firm size (see Aitken \& Harrison 1999 $\rightarrow$ will include citation): find positive within-plant effects and spillover effects on TFP for small firms only (less than 50 employees)
\item Do not measure spillovers on plants that have not received FDI
\item Do not have sector-specific data $\rightarrow$ TECH variable has only 4 categories; e.g. in order to measure spillover effects from other firms in sector this would be necessary (i.e. if a foreign firm is more innovative)
